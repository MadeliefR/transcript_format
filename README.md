### Transcript Formatter

You can use this formatter for your Microsoft Teams transcripts.
It will remove the timestamps and you can replace the names to be anonymous.

1. Create a directory with all your transcripts that you want to format.
2. Add the path of this directory to the script at `#! 1.`
3. Change the name you want to anonymize in the regex at `#! 2.`
4. Run the file and new transcripts will be created and added to the directory. The new filenames will start with "edited_".
